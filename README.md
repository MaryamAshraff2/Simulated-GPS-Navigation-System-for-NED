# 🚩 Campus Navigation System (Simulation-Based GPS)

A simulation-based navigation system built for the NED University campus using static node-edge data and graph search algorithms like A* and Dijkstra’s. The system helps users find the optimal or most comfortable paths across campus, considering factors like distance, shade, and crowd levels.

## 🔍 Features

- 📍 Node-edge representation of campus map (JSON-based)
- ⚙️ A* Algorithm for shortest/time/accessibility-based routing
- 🌿 Modified Dijkstra's Algorithm for comfort-based routing (shade, crowd)
- 🎨 Frontend built with React + Vite
- 📊 Route comparison based on time, distance, and comfort
- 🖼️ Simulation-ready for environments without GPS (e.g., indoor or closed campuses)

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

### A\* (A-Star) Search
- Optimized for shortest path or time
- Uses heuristic (Euclidean distance)

### Comfort-Based Dijkstra's
- Prioritizes shaded, less crowded paths
- Useful for accessible and relaxed navigation
